# JavaScript Quiz!

## Description

My motivation was to design a test that will also test my knowledge on how to properly code logic using JavaScript. I built this project to one test myself with JavaScript language and also to show this on my portfolio to show to employers! This project helps with logic of JS while also testing the user on whatever quiz they want as its very easy to change the questions and answer choices. Ive learned more about JS logic such as for loops and functions as well as local storage while doing this project!
